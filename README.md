# StockDashboard
Dashboard for stock tickers, will have top pics and other analyses tools


To do:
- right now I am trying to get data from the JSON to SQL table
- want to limit the api calls to only when refreshing
- want to keep historical data 
- can have a seperate clean up process 
    - will probably create another repo that will be in charge of cleaning up data daily
